Project Description
We built Rise to Power a political influence text based adventure game. Our game met all of the rubric requirements
which included visual appeal, engaging gameplay, and advanced use of JavaScript and jQuery. One of the interesting things we implemented
was the <progress> tag and we used advanced CSS selectors to style it along with jQuery to update it. In terms of game play, we created an 
interesting story line about a fictional intergalactic nation, and we added a competition element to it as well by allowing the user to 
choose between the People and the Government. Finally, we added consistent styling with use of many CSS semntic tags and a consistent color scheme.
